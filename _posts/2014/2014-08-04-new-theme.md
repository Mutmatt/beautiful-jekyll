After quite some time on the same theme I decided it was time to update. The old theme had some severe limitations in post style, ad additions, analytics, headers, footers. You name it, it was a problem. This theme is based of 'Spacious" which i have, so far, found quite easy to work with. I haven't found anything too out of the ordinary with it so far and everything seems to be working as expected.   

  
I am using a twitter and a github widget on the front page as well as a custom theme widget for the front page layout. The rest of the blog is mostly as you would expect it to be, blogy.
