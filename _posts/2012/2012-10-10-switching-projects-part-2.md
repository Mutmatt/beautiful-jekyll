Wednesday September 12th.  I had 2 meetings this day, one was with the tech lead of the project to make sure I knew what I was going to be doing and a broad spectrum overview of the goal for the next release, the second was with the PM (project manager) to explain the timeline with myself and the other engineer and lay out our project dev plan.

The plan that was laid out for us gave us ~4 weeks until release. I thought well that should be a pretty good time line based on what I've done so far. Well Thursday came and something happened to me similar to my college experiences (on occasion) I had supernova focus. Much to the surprise of the PM and my coworker on the project with me, I finished not only the API but also the full service and parser that is not going to test for 4 more weeks! O.o

**BOOM!!!**
