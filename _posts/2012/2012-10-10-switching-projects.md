### September 11th

Let me start off this post by telling you a short story of my family and the date. Today is September 11th, 2012. Eleven years ago today, the United States had a terrible event occur by extremists from a religious group. I could go into my thoughts on this but no one actually wants to hear that, and that is not why you are here so onto the story.

I have three sisters, the middle, in age, of the three had a child when she was sixteen years old. When the child was born my uncle and his wife decided to adopt her. Fast forward a few years, my uncle was working as a radio show host in the south tower of the world trade center and his wife worked as a video editor (I believe). Well on the night of September 10th, 2001 Taylor, the little girl whom they adopted, came down with a stomach bug and was not able to go to daycare. This meant one of her parents wasn't able to go to work, my uncle drew the short straw and stayed home. Later that morning the tower that he would have been working in fell. . .
  

These are the problems that we should care about and these are the problems that matter. Not the one I will do a short bit of complaining about here:
  

### Actual Post about Software Project Moves

On September 1st I left on my vacation back to Minnesota for my fathers wedding. I left work and knew my supervisor was going to be in charge of any bugs or issues that arose from my work that I had been doing over the last few weeks. I received a few emails with questions and comments while I was out of the office but nothing that a sentence or two couldn't explain. Well, this morning I came into the office with a cup of coffee in my hand and a smile on my face ready to get back to work to be met with some news that, as of this point in the day I am still unsure of the polarity, good or bad. I have been reassigned to a different project and will be changing supervisors.
  

I look forward to the new challenges that await me on this new project and wish my past team good luck (although I will most likely still pester them as I always have).
