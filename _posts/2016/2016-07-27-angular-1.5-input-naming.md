So, here is the thing `ng-model` and `name` on input are two things you should be comfortable seeing if you are in the angular community.  Well, let me tell you something... You will get some seriously weird behavior if those two items are the same.  The form on scope will get weird validation state and your values will be all sorts of FUBAR.  Keep these two magic strings seperate and don't cross the streams.
