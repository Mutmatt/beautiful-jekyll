Well, as I sit here at barrio in terminal 2 of the MSP airport I realize just how big of an opportunity I am bring being presented with. Being a full stack dev looking to separate myself from the crowd I found front end   -  interesting, opinionated, fun, and fulfilling more than other parts. i like to think i bring clarity and simplicity to both code and ui's through my creations. with all the excitement in the world fueling my passion i could only go so far without supporting casts like my wife, my boss, his boss, her boss and ultimately the ceo of my work and the company as a whole. i want to take this trip to better me, as a developer, as a name, as a person, as a leader, and as a valuable employee. much is to be learned and hopefully i can sponge it all. wish me luck!
