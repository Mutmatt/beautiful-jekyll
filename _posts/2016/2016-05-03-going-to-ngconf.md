Well, as I sit here at barrio in terminal 2 of the MSP airport I realize just how big of an opportunity I am bring being presented with. Being a full stack dev looking to separate myself from the crowd I found front end development interesting, opinionated, fun, and fulfilling more than other parts. I like to think I bring clarity and simplicity to both code and ui&#8217;s through my creations. With all the excitement in the world fueling my passion I could only go so far without supporting casts like my wife, my boss, his boss, her boss and ultimately the CEO of my work and the company as a whole. I want to take this trip to better me, as a developer, as a name, as a person, as a leader, and as a valuable employee. Much is to be learned and hopefully i can sponge it all. Wish me luck!
