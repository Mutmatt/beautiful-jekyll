Recently (in the last year or so), I have become quite enthralled in the process of beer brewing. This has not only led into wine making but also other DIY projects. Just last week I made my first attempt at making homemade ginger ale! With all this being said let me introduce you to the new section of MattErickson.ME. **_The Homemade/DIY Section_** (that doesn&#8217;t include coding). 
  

  
Although, I know this is very different from coding and software they aren&#8217;t far from the same. I say this, and believe it, because what drives me most about my job is the _creation_, I get to take nothing and build something. It is my empty canvas (art, not HTML5 :P), it is my winding road, it is my cutting board. 
  

  
So, here is where I would like to share my experiences with you and document fun, new ideas that you may someday like to try as well! 
  

  
Enjoy!
