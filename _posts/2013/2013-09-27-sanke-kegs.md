Since I have started homebrewing there has been one thing that I don&#8217;t like. Bottling. Cleaning, sanitizing, adding sugar, bottling, capping, waiting&#8230; oh the waiting! I hated it.  


  
Recently I received 4 sanke kegs, tubing, and a 6 port manifold from my <a href="http://dazzlingdave.com" title="Dazzling Dave" target="_blank" rel="external">uncle, Dazzling Dave</a>&#8230; who received it from my OTHER uncle Pete who owns <a href="http://detellospizza.us/" title="Detellos" target="_blank" rel="external">Detello&#8217;s Pizza & Pasta</a>.  


  
The problem I had was that the keg&#8217;s spears did not have the retaining rings/clips. Luckily after some internet searches and searching I found a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0062O3W76/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1" title="Amazon Retaining Rings" target="_blank" rel="external">5 pack of retaining rings on amazon</a>. Cheap enough and works perfectly, there is a bit of finagling to get the sanke fittings to sit correctly with them but c&#8217;est la vie.  


  
For reference I will share what my steps were in cleaning and filling.
  


  * Remove spears
  * Soak spears and kegs in clean water with oxyclean for a few (3-4) hours
  * Dump and rinse thoroughly
  * Sanitize however you see fit
  * Run BLC through any lines that would touch the beverages
  * Sanitize lines
  * Siphon beer into kegs
  * Chill and fit spear, C02, and tap lines
  * Turn on C02 to your preferred carbing pressure
  * Enjoy sanke keg beer
