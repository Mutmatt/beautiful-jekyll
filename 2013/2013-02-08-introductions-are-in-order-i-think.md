Hello World!
  

  
Get it?
  

  
&#8230;It&#8217;s a programming joke&#8230;
  

  
&#8230;you know&#8230;like the first program you learn to write?
  

  
Sheesh, rough crowd.
  

  
As you may already have read in Matt&#8217;s most recent post, I&#8217;m the new guy around this site. My name is Tucker, I work in marketing/advertising as a jack-of-all-trades from copywriting to event planning. I&#8217;ve always been interested in technology and tinkering around but rather than learn cool computer stuff in college, I chose to take philosophy classes and play tennis.
  

  
Nice to meet you too.
  

  
So the background behind this collaboration is pretty straightforward, Matt and I have been buddies for a little while now and I am always pestering him with questions like: &#8220;I want to learn coding, how do I do it?&#8221; or, &#8220;What language should I learn?&#8221; or even, &#8220;Does this rash look contagious?&#8221; After a while he said, &#8220;Hey why don&#8217;t you post on my blog? That way you can document your learning, and I can help you as well as anyone else who reads it.&#8221; That&#8217;s our Matt, always looking to help others.
  

  
Well I said, &#8220;Hey that sounds keen!&#8221; Or something like that, and now you get to watch Matt and me transform the caterpillar that is my extremely limited and rudimentary coding knowledge into a beautiful coding butterfly.&nbsp;I hope watching me struggle through coding is informative or, at the very least, entertaining for you.
  

  
Have a safe weekend! (TC)
